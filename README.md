Laravel 4+ Searchy - Searching Made Easy
========================================

Searchy is an easy-to-use Laravel 4+ package that makes running user searches on data in your models easy and effective.
It requires no other software installed on your server (so a bit slower) but can be setup and ready to go in minutes.

### Road Map

So, the intention is to (in the future):

1. Remove Searchy's dependancy on Laravel
2. Include more drivers for more advanced searching (Including file searching, indexing and more)
